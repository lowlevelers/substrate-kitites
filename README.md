# Substrate Kitties by TheLowLevelers

Original version from Substrate Developer Hub is here, please give it a few credits to the team behinds it: https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate-collectables-workshop/#/

> The interactive hands-on build-your-first-blockchain with [Substrate][] workshop

## üñêÔ∏è What is this version made by TheLowLevelers?

The original version is outdated. `substrate-node-template` no longer has a concept of runtime modules but `pallet`. Hence, it is not likable to us the outdated material to learn about Substrate.

## What is this?

This is an interactive hands-on self-paced workshop. You will learn how to build your first blockchain using [Substrate][], the OpenSource [Rust][] Blockchain Development Kit by [Parity][]. Through the lessons of the workshop, you will build a collectables blockchain -- a chain that creates assets, and allows you to interact with and managing ownership of them.

As such, this material will focus on building the logic of this chain. It won't cover the networking, consensus or economic incentive aspects of blockchains. Fortunately, Substrate comes with decent networking and consensus engines built in, so we can just focus on the chain logic.

Substrate is built using [Rust][], a modern statically typed systems programming language. We won't go into the details of the language within this workshop. The language is quite easy to read and follow and if you have programmed before, you shouldn't have too much trouble following what is going on and finishing the exercises even if [Rust][] is new to you.

## How do I do this?

Just go through the material chapter by chapter, do one exercise at a time. While the material is meant for you to be able to do on your own, we highly recommend you to get together and work on it with others, in learning groups or hosted workshops. It is totally normal to get stuck from time to time or to not understand what the material is attempting to explain. In those situations it helps a lot to have others around to talk to about it and resolve that frustration. That said, we highly appreciate any [feedback regarding the material, and where you might got stuck][feedback].

Before committing to the tasks in the community, please skim through the guidelines below to grasp the overall idea of how the community works first. It does not take long but I believe it will give you a big picture of the vision and culture of TheLowLevelers.

## Acknowledgements

Open source projects like Substrate and this workshop could not be successful without the collective minds and collaborative effort of the development community.

The Substratekitties workshop stands on the backs of giants like [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/), [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/), [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), [David Revoy's Cat Avatar Generator](https://framagit.org/Deevad/cat-avatar-generator), and numerous volunteers to report errors and bugs along the way.

We hope this educational material teaches you something new, and in turn, you teach others too.
